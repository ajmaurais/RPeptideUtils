}

\description{
Get protein sequences for a vector of uniprot IDs
}
\examples{
#By default the fasta file included in the package containing human protein sequences is used.
getSequences(c("A0MZ66", "A6NMY6", "O00213", "O00213"))

#A fasta file can also be manually spedified.
fasta_path <- system.file('extdata/Human_uniprot-reviewed_20171020.fasta', package = 'peptideUtils')
